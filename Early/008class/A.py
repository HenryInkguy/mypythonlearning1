from math import sqrt # from module import function (To import only specific functions from a module.)

# Examples

math.ceil # Ceiling rounding (Rounding for the higher number. Ex: 5.5 rounds to 6)
math.floor # Floor rounding (Rounding for the lower number. Ex: 5.5 rounds to 5)
math.trunc # Truncate, eliminates all the numbers after a "." (Ex: 5.23874892174 truncates to 5. Without rounding at all.)
math.pow # Power, exponentiation, basic stuff.
math.sqrt # Square root, you definitely knows what that means.
math.factorial # Factorial, I guess you know that.
